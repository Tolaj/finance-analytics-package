# 🎯 Usage Examples

Below are usage samples for each module.  
Full examples available in `examples/demo_examples.py`.

---

## 1️⃣ Time Value of Money

```python
from fincalc import time_value

fv = time_value.future_value(1000, rate=0.08, years=5)
pv = time_value.present_value(2000, rate=0.05, years=3)
npv = time_value.net_present_value(0.08, [-1000, 300, 300, 300, 400])

print("Future Value:", fv)
print("Present Value:", pv)
print("NPV:", npv)
```

---


## 2️⃣ Cash Flow Analysis

```python
from fincalc import cashflow

cfs = [-1000, 300, 300, 300, 400]

irr = cashflow.internal_rate_of_return(cfs)
mirr = cashflow.modified_irr(cfs, finance_rate=0.08, reinvest_rate=0.06)
payback = cashflow.payback_period(cfs)
discounted_pb = cashflow.discounted_payback(cfs, rate=0.08)

print("IRR:", irr)
print("MIRR:", mirr)
print("Payback:", payback)
print("Discounted Payback:", discounted_pb)
```

### Visualize cashflows
```python
from fincalc import visualization as viz
viz.plot_cashflows(cfs)
```

---

## 3️⃣ Loan Payment & Amortization

```python
from fincalc import loans

payment = loans.loan_payment(200000, annual_rate=0.05, years=30)
schedule = loans.amortization_schedule(200000, 0.05, 30)

print("Monthly Payment:", payment)
print("First Entry:", schedule[0])
```

### Plot amortization
```python
from fincalc import visualization as viz
viz.plot_amortization(schedule)
```

---

## 4️⃣ Asset Depreciation

```python
from fincalc import depreciation

deps = depreciation.straight_line(10000, salvage=1000, life=5)
ddb = depreciation.double_declining_balance(10000, life=5)

print("Straight-line Depreciation:", deps)
print("Double Declining Balance:", ddb)
```

### Plot depreciation
```python
from fincalc import visualization as viz
viz.plot_depreciation(deps)
```

---

## 5️⃣ Bond Valuation

```python
from fincalc import bonds

price = bonds.bond_price(1000, coupon_rate=0.05, yield_rate=0.06, years=10)
ytm = bonds.yield_to_maturity(price, 1000, 0.05, 10)
duration = bonds.duration(1000, 0.05, 0.06, 10)
convexity = bonds.convexity(1000, 0.05, 0.06, 10)

print("Bond Price:", price)
print("YTM:", ytm)
print("Duration:", duration)
print("Convexity:", convexity)
```

---

# 📈 Visualization Examples

### NPV Profile
```python
import numpy as np
from fincalc import time_value, visualization as viz

rates = np.linspace(0.01, 0.2, 20)
cfs = [-1000, 300, 300, 300, 400]
npvs = [time_value.net_present_value(r, cfs) for r in rates]

viz.plot_npv_profile(rates, npvs)
```

---






# 🧪 Testing

Recommended tests:
